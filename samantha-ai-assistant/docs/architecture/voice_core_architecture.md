# Voice Core Engine Architecture

## 1. Purpose

The Voice Core Engine is responsible for handling all voice-related interactions within the Samantha AI Assistant. This includes:
- Capturing audio input from the user.
- Transcribing spoken language into text.
- Processing transcribed text to identify user intent and extract commands.
- Synthesizing spoken responses from text.
- Playing back audio responses to the user.

Its primary goal is to provide a seamless, efficient, and natural voice-based interface for the AI assistant.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The Voice Core Engine will be structured as a pipeline, with distinct modules handling specific stages of voice processing. This modular approach ensures maintainability, scalability, and flexibility for integrating different technologies at each stage.

## 3. Key Modules and Responsibilities

### 3.1. Audio Capture Module

*   **Purpose**: Manages the acquisition of audio data from the user's microphone or other input sources.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Initialize and manage audio input streams.
    *   Handle audio buffering and pre-processing (e.g., noise reduction, volume normalization).
    *   Provide raw audio data to the Transcription Module.
    *   Manage audio input device selection and configuration.

### 3.2. Transcription Module

*   **Purpose**: Converts raw audio data into text.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Integrate with a speech-to-text (STT) service (e.g., `nodejs-whisper`, cloud-based STT).
    *   Process audio chunks and send them to the STT service.
    *   Receive and format transcription results.
    *   Handle real-time transcription and final transcription.

### 3.3. Intent & Command Processing Module

*   **Purpose**: Analyzes transcribed text to understand user intent and identify executable commands.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Utilize Natural Language Understanding (NLU) techniques.
    *   Map user utterances to predefined intents and extract relevant entities/parameters.
    *   Interface with the `ai-engine` package for complex command execution and conversational logic.
    *   Generate structured command objects for the backend.

### 3.4. Response Synthesis Module

*   **Purpose**: Converts text-based responses into spoken audio.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Integrate with a text-to-speech (TTS) service.
    *   Receive text responses from the AI engine.
    *   Generate audio data from the text.
    *   Handle different voice profiles and languages.

### 3.5. Audio Playback Module

*   **Purpose**: Manages the playback of synthesized audio responses to the user.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Initialize and manage audio output streams.
    *   Queue and play audio buffers.
    *   Handle audio output device selection and configuration.
    *   Manage audio interruptions and mixing (if necessary).

## 4. Data Flow

1.  **Audio Input**: Raw audio stream from microphone.
2.  **Audio Capture Module**: Buffers and pre-processes audio, passes `AudioFormat` objects to Transcription Module.
3.  **Transcription Module**: Converts `AudioFormat` to `TranscriptionResult` (text), passes to Intent & Command Processing Module.
4.  **Intent & Command Processing Module**: Processes `TranscriptionResult` to determine `CommandResult` (intent + parameters), potentially interacting with external AI services. Passes `CommandResult` to backend/AI engine.
5.  **Backend/AI Engine**: Processes `CommandResult`, generates a text `Response`.
6.  **Response Synthesis Module**: Converts text `Response` into audio `AudioFormat` objects.
7.  **Audio Playback Module**: Plays back `AudioFormat` objects to the user.

## 5. Technical Considerations

*   **Real-time Performance**: Minimize latency across the entire pipeline for a responsive user experience.
*   **Resource Management**: Efficient use of CPU, memory, and network resources.
*   **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between modules to allow for easy swapping of underlying technologies (e.g., different STT/TTS providers).
*   **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging at each stage of the pipeline.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Design for compatibility across different operating systems and environments.

## 6. Next Steps

1.  **Detailed Module Design**: Define interfaces and specific technologies for each module.
2.  **Proof of Concept**: Implement a basic end-to-end voice pipeline.
3.  **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish metrics and optimize critical paths.
4.  **Integration with AI Engine**: Develop the communication protocols between voice-core and ai-engine.
5.  **Comprehensive Testing**: Build out unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
