    -   **ElevenLabs TTS Integration**: Integrate text-to-speech capabilities for Samantha's responses.
    -   **Basic Mac Automation**: Implement initial macOS automation functionalities (e.g., opening applications, basic system commands) within the `mac-automation` package.
    -   **End-to-End Voice Command Flow (CLI)**: Demonstrate a complete voice command to system execution flow via a command-line interface, proving the core pipeline.
    -   **Initial Backend API**: Develop core FastAPI endpoints for receiving audio, processing commands, and returning responses.
    -   **Unit & Integration Tests**: Implement tests for core voice processing and AI integration components.

## Phase 3: Desktop Application & User Interface (Alpha)

-   **Duration**: 6-8 Weeks
-   **Milestones**:
    -   **Electron App Setup**: Initialize the Electron desktop application (`apps/desktop`).
    -   **Basic UI Components**: Develop essential UI components using Next.js and `ui-components` for microphone input, status display, and basic settings.
    -   **Real-time Audio Streaming**: Implement efficient audio streaming from the desktop app to the backend.
    -   **User Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement visual and audio cues for listening, processing, and responding.
    -   **Settings & Configuration**: Allow users to configure wake word, voice, and basic automation preferences.
    -   **Error Handling & User Notifications**: Implement robust error handling and user-friendly notifications for command failures or issues.
    -   **Comprehensive Testing**: Conduct alpha testing with a small group of users.

## Phase 4: Web Management Interface & Advanced Features (Beta)

-   **Duration**: 4-6 Weeks
-   **Milestones**:
    -   **Next.js Web App Setup**: Initialize the Next.js web application (`apps/web`).
    -   **User Management (Optional)**: If multi-user support is planned, implement basic user authentication and profile management.
    -   **Command History & Customization**: Allow users to view command history and define custom commands/macros via the web interface.
    -   **Plugin System (Future)**: Design and implement a basic plugin architecture for extending Samantha's capabilities.
    -   **Advanced Mac Automation**: Expand `mac-automation` with more complex system interactions (e.g., file management, specific app integrations).
    -   **Deployment Automation**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment of all applications.
    -   **Beta Testing**: Conduct beta testing with a wider user base.

## Phase 5: Polish, Documentation & Deployment (1.0 Release)

-   **Duration**: 2-3 Weeks
-   **Milestones**:
    -   **Performance Tuning**: Final round of performance optimizations based on beta feedback.
    -   **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete `docs/architecture`, `docs/api`, and `docs/user-guide`.
    -   **Security Audit**: Review for potential security vulnerabilities.
    -   **Packaging & Distribution**: Prepare the desktop application for distribution (e.g., `.dmg` for macOS).
    -   **Marketing & Launch Prep**: Prepare marketing materials and launch strategy.
    -   **Public Release**: Launch Samantha AI Assistant 1.0.

## Ongoing
